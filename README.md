- ## Space Optimized Approach

    - ### Intuition
        - A circular sentence requires that:
            - The last character of each word matches the first character of the following word.
            - Additionally, the first character of the first word must match the last character of the last word.

            The goal is to ensure that all transitions between words maintain this character matching, creating a circular structure.

    - ### Approach

        1. **Initial Character Check**:
            - Retrieve the first character of the first word and the last character of the last word.
            - If these two characters do not match, return `False`.

        2. **Iterate Through the Sentence**:
            - Use a loop to go through each character in the sentence.
            - When a space is encountered, check the last character of the previous word and the first character of the next word.
            - If they do not match, return `False`.

        3. **Return True**: 
            - If all checks pass, return `True`, indicating the sentence is circular.

    - ### Time Complexity
        
        - The algorithm processes each character in the sentence once, leading to a time complexity of __\(O(n)\)__, where __\(n\)__ is the length of the sentence.

    - ### Space Complexity

        - The space used is constant, as the algorithm only utilizes a few variables to keep track of characters and indices. Thus, the space complexity is __\(O(1)\)__.

    - ### Code
        ```python3 []
        class Solution:
            def isCircularSentence(self, sentence: str) -> bool:
                n = len(sentence)  # Get the length of the sentence
                index = 0  # Initialize index to iterate through the sentence

                # Store the first character of the first word
                first_Character_of_First_Word_of_Sentence = sentence[0]
                # Store the last character of the last word
                last_Character_of_Last_Word_of_Sentence = sentence[-1]

                # Check if the first character of the first word matches the last character of the last word
                if first_Character_of_First_Word_of_Sentence != last_Character_of_Last_Word_of_Sentence:
                    return False  # Return False if they do not match
                
                # Iterate through each character in the sentence
                while index < n:
                    current_Character = sentence[index]

                    # Check for spaces to identify word boundaries
                    if current_Character == ' ':
                        last_Character_of_Previous_Word = sentence[index - 1]  # Last character of the previous word
                        first_Character_of_Next_Word = sentence[index + 1]  # First character of the next word

                        # Check if the last character of the last word matches the first character of the next word
                        if last_Character_of_Previous_Word != first_Character_of_Next_Word:
                            return False  # Return False if they do not match
                    
                    index += 1  # Move to the next character

                return True  # Return True if all checks pass
        ```
